# Obsidian-Excalidraw-Eample-Vault

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](docs/README_ZH.md)

This is a packaged obsidian vault that includes the [modified excalidraw plugin](https://github.com/Bowen-0x00/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin-ymjr) and many [custom scripts](https://github.com/Bowen-0x00/obsidian-excalidraw-scripts). 

It contains pre-made excalidraw canvas files that showcase some interesting features (not all, still a work in progress).

It is convenient for friends who are not familiar with how to install plugins and set up the obsidian-excalidraw-plugin to directly experiment with the features (open with Obsidian) and refer to the example vault settings.

You can watch this [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zN4y1H7Dx/?vd_source=2a4c442f72a74e8d915c1fb5f59d4ba4) to quickly see some of the features: Video.

## Installation and Usage
This is a packaged obsidian vault that includes the modified plugin and many custom scripts. You can directly open it with Obsidian and experience the features.

1. Clone or download the compressed package and extract it.
2. Open Obsidian and select this folder (the folder you cloned or extracted in the previous step).

## Porting Features to Your Own vault
Some features require a combination of custom scripts and the modified excalidraw plugin, while others only require custom scripts.

In the README of the [custom scripts](https://github.com/Bowen-0x00/obsidian-excalidraw-scripts), a table is provided listing the scripts required for each feature, but it is not yet complete and is still being written.

If you are unsure about which scripts are needed for a specific feature or how to configure them, you can contact me.

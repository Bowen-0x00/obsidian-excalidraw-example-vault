# Obsidian-Excalidraw-Eample-Vault

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](docs/README_ZH.md)

This repository showcases some functionalities achievable using a [modified Excalidraw plugin](https://github.com/Bowen-0x00/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin-ymjr) and [custom scripts](https://github.com/Bowen-0x00/obsidian-excalidraw-scripts). (not all, still a work in progress).

It provides an easy way for friends unfamiliar with plugin installation and setting up the Obsidian-Excalidraw plugin to quickly experiment with the features and refer to the example repository's configurations.

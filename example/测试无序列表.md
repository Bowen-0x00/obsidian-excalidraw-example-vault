	- 1964
		- CDC 6600
		- The CDC 6600 was the flagship of the 6000 series of mainframe computer systems manufactured by Control Data Corporation.[8][9] Generally considered to be the first successful supercomputer. LS、Scoreboard、Dynamic scheduling.
	- 1971
		- Intel 4004
		- The Intel 4004 is a 4-bit central processing unit (CPU) released by Intel Corporation in 1971. Sold for US$60 (equivalent to $450 in 2023[2]), it was the first commercially produced microprocessor,[3] and the first in a long line of Intel CPUs.
	- 1976
		-  Cray-1
		- The Cray-1, introduced in 1976, was a groundbreaking supercomputer designed by Seymour Cray. It featured innovative vector processing and a distinctive C-shaped design, achieving a peak performance of 160 megaflops, making it the fastest computer in the world at the time. Its success established Cray Research as a leader in supercomputing.
	- 1978
		- Intel 8086
		- The 8086, introduced by Intel in 1978, was a pioneering 16-bit microprocessor that laid the foundation for the x86 architecture. It featured a 20-bit address bus, allowing access to 1 MB of memory, and utilized a segmented memory model to manage this space efficiently. The 8086's instruction set and architecture innovations enabled the development of the personal computer industry, setting a standard for compatibility and performance.
	- 1998
		- DEC Alpha 21264
		- The Alpha 21264, released by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1996, was a significant leap in microprocessor technology. It introduced out-of-order execution, allowing instructions to be processed as resources became available rather than in strict sequence. Along with advanced branch prediction and a highly parallel superscalar architecture, the 21264 could execute multiple instructions per cycle, dramatically enhancing performance and establishing new benchmarks in high-performance computing.
